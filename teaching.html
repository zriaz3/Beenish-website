                    <li>Beenish Riaz is one of the most understanding and engaging TAs I have ever had. She knew I was going through a difficult time and helped me through that period. She always made discussions interesting and always had time to answer our questions. I have no critiques. She was a great discussion leader, a fair grader, and I feel lucky to have been in her section</li>
                    <li>Beenish was a great TA. She made our discussion sections very engaging and helpful. I found her discussion sections more helpful and important than the lectures. She also returned our assignments quickly.</li>
                    <li>Beenish is great!!! During our discussions, she provided us with most important points of the previous lectures and reading material, clarifying any and all questions and leading the discussion where we not only answered individually but also worked in groups. Her slides were also very helpful for the assignments. Beenish was also very generous with her time outside of class, extending her office hours and meeting with me individually whenever I had questions or need further clarification.</li>
                    <li>She was great, I feel lucky to have her as my TA because she was always prepared and brought a calm, collected, and welcoming energy to discussion. I felt like I learned a bit and wasn't super stressed about the atmosphere enabling open and inquisitive discussion that I really valued</li>
